      <description>Head of OT Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Innovation Lab (01/2023 - present) Sababa Security
Recent events are highlighting even more how Cybersecurity in the OT world is developing into one of the most fundamental areas in the field, especially when it comes to the protection of critical infrastructures and strategic industrial sites. • After having matured 20+ years of experience in PLC and SCADA systems, I have now taken up the leadership of Sababa&amp;rsquo;s OT Cybersecurity, with particular focus on the ICS, Automotive and Industrial IoT sectors.</description>

      <title>SCADAsploit module: Modbus Payload Transfer</title>

      <description>The second module we are going to explore is called &amp;ldquo;Modbus Payload Transfer&amp;rdquo; and belongs to the auxiliary category.
What is it for The &amp;ldquo;Modbus Payload Transfer&amp;rdquo; module is a script that allows you to store and retrieve a payload/shellcode in the &amp;ldquo;holding registers&amp;rdquo; of a PLC via the Modbus TCP protocol. There are many PLCs exposed to the Internet, with this module it is possible to exploit their memory to upload a payload (shellcode/malware) so that it can be recovered at a later time.</description>

      <title>SCADAsploit module: Modbus Scan</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get to know SCADAsploit a little better starting from one of the auxiliary modules present: Modbus Scan.
Position ourselves in the folder where we installed SCADAsploit and start it using the command $ ./scadasploit.py. Following the same approach philosophy of Metasploit, we can search for all modules that contain a keyword using the search &amp;lt;keyword&amp;gt; command or display the complete list of modules present with the show modules command.</description>

      <description>This section is dedicated to SCADAsploit, a framework I&amp;rsquo;m working on dedicated to OT/ICS penetration testing. You ask yourself: &amp;ldquo;But isn&amp;rsquo;t Metasploit already doing this?&amp;rdquo;. Certain! So what is the need to create a new tool like this? I try to give some answers:
framework exclusively dedicated to vulnerabilities of SCADA, PLC and other ICS devices written in Python, both the core of the framework and the modules &amp;ldquo;Metasploit like&amp;rdquo; interface greater focus on the installed PLC fleet, especially in Europe.</description>

      <title>Hacking: Pentest on a PLC</title>

      <description>Penetration Test on a PLC Protecting an ICS environment, including PLCs, is not trivial, as these systems are not designed to be resilient to cyber attacks. This means that you have to somehow integrate cybersecurity resilience measures inside and around the ICS. Such measures include, for example:
perimeter protection, such as firewalls to reduce the risk of unwanted network traffic; network monitoring - preferably non-intrusive, ICS-specific, anomaly-based monitoring so as not to create any additional load on ICS networks; endpoint protection and monitoring to reduce the exposure of PLCs to attacks via remote connections.</description>

      <title>Hacking: finding SCADA on Internet using Google Dorks</title>

      <description>It is estimated that Google has stored more pages than any other search engine in the world. With more than billions of pages and a relatively low execution time, the popular Californian search engine manages to satisfy all searches, whether performed for curiosity or for less harmless purposes. It is so powerful that it can categorise over 15 million pages in less than a minute.
Moreover, it is assumed that 60+ thousand searches are conducted through Google&amp;rsquo;s search engine every second.</description>

      <title>Differences between IT and OT</title>
      <link>https://scadasploit.dev/posts/2021/07/differences-between-it-and-ot/</link>

      <description>For those coming from IT, securing ICS systems can be frustrating at the beginning. This is because the technologies used and the ways of working are very different when it comes to OT systems. The objectives pursued in these two areas are also very different. How so? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out.
Data protection vs. process protection When securing IT systems, the main focus is on protecting data - such as intellectual property (IP), credit card numbers, emails and Personal Identifiable Information (PII) - thus trying to prevent hackers from gaining access to what, for a company, may be a great part of its assets.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s interconnected world, OT systems are the backbone of critical infrastructures such as power plants, manufacturing facilities, and transportation networks. However, their unique security challenges demand a specialized approach. With SCADAsploit, you gain a powerful ally in identifying vulnerabilities and fortifying the defenses of your OT environment.
SCADAsploit can emulate different stages of an attacker killchain, and provide exploitation modules to help the SOC to validate the attacks and improve the internal defensive mechanisms.</description>
