<p>It is estimated that Google has stored more pages than any other search engine in the world. With more than billions of pages and a relatively low execution time, the popular Californian search engine manages to satisfy all searches, whether performed for curiosity or for less harmless purposes. It is so powerful that it can categorise over 15 million pages in less than a minute.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is assumed that 60+ thousand searches are conducted through Google&rsquo;s search engine every second. This means over <strong>1 trillion</strong> searches per year. These are astronomical numbers that Google manages to keep up with thanks to the enormous infrastructure it has set up.</p>
<p>Certainly, search engines have turned many people&rsquo;s lives upside down; having so much information in the space of 1 minute is food for thought for anyone. But the most surprising thing, despite these numbers, is that we exploit only a very small part of the potential that this tool offers us.</p>
<p>Few people know that Google has a proprietary language to extract information beyond the normal keyword search. Even with little knowledge of Google keywords, you can find much more information than you ever imagined. Let&rsquo;s look at some of them.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-google-dorks">What are Google Dorks</h2>
<p>Dorks are defined as search queries that, instead of simply containing a description of what we are looking for, are also composed of several keywords that allow us to refine the parameters of the search in order to obtain specific results.</p>
<h3 id="purposes-for-which-they-are-used">Purposes for which they are used</h3>
<p>As mentioned, dorks are mainly used to refine search results, in order to have a more specific list of links. For instance, let&rsquo;s try searching for <em>&lsquo;pizza napoletana&rsquo;</em>. The simple word <em>&lsquo;pizza&rsquo;</em>, searched on Google, has more than 1,360,000,000 results, while combined with the word <em>‘napoletana’</em>, the results drop dramatically (still more than 15 million). This is already an attempt to refine our search and narrow the search field.</p>
<p>Starting from the assumption that some sysadmins may not have applied certain rules, it is possible to search for certain confidential and/or reserved files, not intended for the general public on the Internet. Be careful, however: although some webmasters expose sensitive information on their own, this does not mean that it is legal to exploit it in order to gain an advantage (economic or not). Simple consultation is not a crime, but exploitation is and is prosecuted. It is quite easy to trace the surfing IP, even if a VPN service is used.</p>
<p>Many vulnerabilities are searched for by <strong>script kiddies</strong> precisely through Google. A careful query in fact searches for error messages, configuration files or anything else that could somehow expose software versions or confidential data to the outside world.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that dorks can be concatenated to further refine our search, such as <code>ext:ini intext:env.ini</code> or <code>ext:mdb inurl:*.mdb inurl:fpdb shop.mdb</code> .</p>
<h2 id="google-dorks-for-scada">Google Dorks for SCADA</h2>
<p>It must be said that there is no single Google dork that will reveal every SCADA interface that exists on the network, this is because it depends very much on the manufacturer and the products used. Each company creates its own embedded systems with proprietary features. They share common protocols and procedures, but in general they are unique objects.</p>
<p>Some of the main manufacturers are: Siemens, Schneider Electric, Rockwell Automation, GE. In addition to this, it must be considered that each of these companies produces several products belonging to the same family, so research requires that specific Google Dorks are developed for each of them. Below is a brief summary of some of the main brands and their queries.</p>
<div class="container">

      src="localhost/images/2021/dorks_1.png"
      class="my_img"
    />
</div>
<h3 id="using-google-dorks">Using Google Dorks</h3>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s try some dorks to find specific SCADA systems, starting with one of the most widely used products in automation systems in Italy: Siemens&rsquo; S7 series PLC. As a note, let me remind you that this is the same family of controllers that were the target of the infamous Stuxnet attack against Iran&rsquo;s Natanz nuclear power plant in 2010, probably the most sophisticated SCADA attack to date.</p>
<p>Our Google Dork looks like this: <code>inurl:/Portal/Portal.mwsl</code></p>
<p>When we use it in a Google search, we get the results shown below.</p>
<div class="container">
  <img
      src="localhost/images/2021/dorks_2.png"
      class="my_img"
    />
</div>
<p>If we select the first item in the list (Siemens S7-1200_1) we access the following page:</p>
<div class="container">
  <img
      src="localhost/images/2021/dorks_3.png"
      class="my_img"
    />
</div>
<p>This appears to be the Siemens S7 PLC administration portal somewhere in the world. To continue our search, we enter the IP address Google gave us (78.218.196.95) into Shodan to see where it is located. It is in Bruyères, France.</p>
<div class="container">
  <img
      src="localhost/images/2021/shodan_siemens_1.png"
      class="my_img"
    />
</div>
<p>When clicking on the <strong>Identification</strong> tab on the left, the PLC identifies itself as an S7-1200_1/PLC_1 station. It also gives us the serial number and firmware version (thus simplifying a possible attack).</p>
<div class="container">
  <img
      src="localhost/images/2021/shodan_siemens_2.png"
      class="my_img"
    />
</div>
<p>The same thing happens if we click on <strong>Communication</strong> from the menu on the left.</p>
<div class="container">
  <img
      src="localhost/images/2021/shodan_siemens_3.png"
      class="my_img"
    />
</div>
<p>As we can see, the security of ICS systems is still in its infancy, relying mainly on security by obscurity. These simple Google Dorks all too easily expose often critical systems without the slightest security criterion. Even a hacker with basic skills can access control systems and create chaos.</p>
