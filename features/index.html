<h2 id="flexible-and-powerful-architecture">Flexible and Powerful Architecture</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Client/Server Architecture</strong>: SCADAsploit boasts a robust client/server architecture that ensures seamless communication and collaboration between your team members. This scalable framework enables efficient distribution of tasks and enhances your offensive capabilities, allowing you to penetrate even the most complex OT environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Client Connections</strong>: we prioritize the utmost security in SCADAsploit, providing you with the option to connect through industry-leading encryption protocols. Choose between Wireguard or Blu5 SElink, both renowned for their military-grade encryption capabilities, capable of communicating even with very little bandwidth available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Beacon (Injector Agent)</strong>: the beacon can be used in both a stageless and staged version to incorporate advanced evasion tricks, anti-debugging measures, and anti-sandboxing capabilities. It offers a range of process injection techniques and allows users to choose between WinAPI, NTAPI, and Indirect Syscalls. It also supports multiple pivot options, including SMB, TCP, WMI, WinRM, and the management of remote services via RPC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>External C2</strong>: the SMB and TCP variants of the beacon enable the creation of custom External C2 channels, allowing communication through legitimate websites like Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, and more, enhancing evasion capabilities.</p>
